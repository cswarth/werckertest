This repo is a demonstration of using [Wercker](wercker.com) to
automate a simple service.  The service converts of a CSV
file to an HTML table and pushes the results up to gihub-pages.  Every time the sample.csv file is changed in
this repo, the web page at
[cswarth.github.io/werckertest/output.html](cswarth.github.io/werckertest/output.html)
will be updated.
